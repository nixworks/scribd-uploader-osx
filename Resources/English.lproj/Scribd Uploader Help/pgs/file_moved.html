						<p class="Para">If you added a file to Scribd Uploader&rsquo;s file list, without uploading that file, and then later moved or deleted that file in the Finder, Scribd Uploader will no longer be able to find it.</p>
						<p class="Para">If this happens, Scribd Uploader will not be able to upload the file. If you click Upload, a <img src="../gfx/error_icon.png" alt="Exclamation mark in circle" /> icon will appear next to the file. Clicking this icon will reveal an alert explaining that the file could not be found. The next time you launch Scribd Uploader, the file will be removed from your list.</p>
						<p class="Para">If you quit Scribd Uploader before moving or deleting a file, the next time you launch Scribd Uploader, it will inform you that the file cannot be found and has been removed from your file list.</p>
						<p class="Para">In either case, if you moved the file, you will have to add it to the queue again to upload it.</p>
