						<p class="Para"><a href="http://www.scribd.com">Scribd.com</a> is a website where users can share their documents with others. Scribd is the place where you publish, discover and discuss original writings and documents. More than 50 million people each month are finding or sharing fun, functional or fantastical writings and documents on Scribd.com and tens of thousands of other websites that have embedded Scribd&rsquo;s document reader.</p>
						<p class="Para">With Scribd&rsquo;s iPaper document reader, anyone can easily upload and immediately share their original works on Scribd.com or any other website. iPaper transforms PDF, Word, PowerPoint and many other file formats into an elegant web display. Your work can be shared with Scribd&rsquo;s community of passionate readers, and because every word of your document is indexed for search engine optimization, your screenplay, novel or even sheet music and recipes also can be discovered by the world.</p>
						<p class="Para">You can create (or liberate from your hard drive) anything you want to share &mdash; that comparative essay on Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, the first three chapters of the book you&rsquo;ve been meaning to finish, journal entries from your trip to Thailand&hellip; Scribd provides a creative and useful new platform for readers, authors, publishers and anyone else seeking to express themselves, share ideas and exchange information.</p>
						<p class="Para">For more advanced users, Scribd offers many e-commerce features like document selling, publisher storefronts, and advertising revenue sharing. Visit the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/publisher">Scribd Publisher page</a> for information on how Scribd can connect customers with your printed products.</p>
