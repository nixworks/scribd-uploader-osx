						<p class="Para">Scribd Uploader is never intentionally released with significant bugs, although occasionally we may elect to release the product with minor bugs. <a href="help:anchor='known_bugs' bookID=Scribd Uploader Help">View a list of bugs we already know about.</a></p>
						<p class="Para">If you find a bug or other unexpected behavior in Scribd Uploader, you can report it to us by emailing the lead developer, Tim Morgan, at <a href="mailto:tim@scribd.com">tim@scribd.com</a>. Please provide as much information as you feel might be helpful. If you are familiar with Mac OS X applications like Console, information from those utilities can also be helpful.</p>
						<p class="Para">If Scribd Uploader crashes, Finder will display a dialog allowing you to report the crash. Unfortunately, this reports the crash to Apple, not to us, so it doesn&rsquo;t do us very much good. You can, however, still get us the information, by following the steps below, once the crash notification dialog appears.</p>
