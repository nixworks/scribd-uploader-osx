					<div class="Intro">
						<p class="Para">If you click the Information button in the toolbar (or choose Show Information from the Window menu), a drawer will appear where you can add and edit metadata about your document.</p>
						<p class="Para">Scribd uses this metadata to help others find your document. For example, if you tag your document with the word &ldquo;cobbler,&rdquo; then people looking for cobbler (both on Scribd and on Google) will be more likely to find your document. Setting metadata for your document is especially important if you show ads on your document or if you sell it using Scribd, because more people means more sales!</p>
						<p class="Para">There are a number of different kinds of information you can give about your document:</p>
						<ul class="ListDescriptor">
							<li>
								<div class="Term">Upload as private:  </div>
								<div class="Description">If you check this box, your document will be visible only to you and those you trust. (See <a href="help:anchor='sharing_privately' bookID=Scribd Uploader Help">Sharing private files with another trusted person</a>.) Your document will not appear in Google, or in Scribd search results or on any other web page.</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="Term">Title:  </div>
								<div class="Description">Scribd Uploader will suggest a good title for your document based on its file name. If you&rsquo;d like to change that title, you can do so here. A better title will make people more likely to find your document authentic and authoritative.</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="Term">Description:  </div>
								<div class="Description">You can write a summary or synopsis of your document here. What you type will help Scribd and other websites show your document to the right people when they look for it.</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="Term">Category:  </div>
								<div class="Description">Click the Change button to pick a category and/or subcategory for your documents. If you categorize your document, it will appear on Scribd.com when people browse or search documents by a category. It also makes your document more likely to be featured on the home page or in other prominent places.</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<div class="Term">Tags:  </div>
								<div class="Description">The words you type here will help others find your document and will also link your document to similar ones, to help people researching a topic. As you type, Scribd Uploader will suggest completions for you from a list of the most common tags on Scribd.com.</div>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="Outro">
						<p class="Para">The discoverability meter at the bottom helps you gauge how likely it is that others will be able to find your document. The more bars that light up, the more likely your document will appear on Scribd.com search and browse pages, and also as a result on Google searches. You can increase your document&rsquo;s discoverability by adding more information to all the above fields. If your document is marked as private, it will have a zero discoverability.</p>
