						<p class="Para">This is an error that occurs when creating a Scribd.com account if you provide an email address that belongs to someone else already on the website. This is generally because of a few different scenarios.</p>
						<p class="Para"><strong>You have already signed up for a Scribd.com account with that email:</strong> Log in to your existing Scribd.com account instead of creating a new one. If you forgot your password, read <a href="help:anchor='forgot_password' bookID=Scribd Uploader Help">I forgot my Scribd.com password</a>.</p>
						<p class="Para"><strong>You are trying to sign up with an email address that belongs to someone else:</strong> You must use an email address that you own and have access to for your Scribd.com account.</p>
						<p class="Para"><strong>Someone else has signed up for Scribd.com using your email address:</strong> You will need to reclaim your email address by proving that it&rsquo;s yours. To do so, follow the steps below.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Task">
						<div class="Name">Reclaiming an email address:</div>
						<ol class="ListNumber">
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Open <a href="http://www.scribd.com">www.scribd.com</a> in your web browser.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Click the Sign Up link in the upper right-hand corner of the web page.</p>
								<p class="Para">A lightbox will appear where you can re-enter the account information.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Enter the username, email address, and password you gave to Scribd Uploader.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Click the Sign Up button.</p>
								<p class="Para">A second lightbox will appear where you can provide additional information for Scribd. You can skip this lightbox if you wish.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="Para">After a short delay, check for new email at the address you provided. You should receive a new email from Scribd requesting that you verify your email address.</p>
								<p class="Para">The email may take some time to appear.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Open the email and click the Verify Your Email button.</p>
								<p class="Para">The button will open a new page in your web browser indicating that your email address has been verified and claimed as yours.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
