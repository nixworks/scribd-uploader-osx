					<div class="Intro">
						<p class="Para">The first time you run Scribd Uploader, it may ask you if you want to move the program to the Applications folder. This will happen if you run it from a different folder, like the Downloads folder, where it may have been placed after you downloaded it.</p>
						<p class="Para">Scribd Uploader will work in any folder. You can leave it in the folder where it currently is, put it on the Desktop, or anywhere you please. The Applications folder is the default place for programs on your computer, however, and many people like to consolidate their programs into one folder.</p>
						<p class="Para">Click the Move button if you would like Scribd Uploader to place itself in the Applications folder along with your other programs. Click this button if you&rsquo;ve just downloaded Scribd Uploader and haven&rsquo;t yet moved it yourself. Scribd Uploader will be copied to the Applications folder, the original copy will be placed in the Trash, and the program will be relaunched from the Applications folder.</p>
						<p class="Para">Click the Don&rsquo;t Move button if you&rsquo;ve already placed Scribd Uploader into a folder and you&rsquo;d like to keep it there. You will not be asked if you want to move Scribd Uploader the next time you launch it.</p>
