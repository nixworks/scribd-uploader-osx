						<p class="Para">This program uploads your files to a website called Scribd.com. (For more information, read <a href="help:anchor='about_website' bookID=Scribd Uploader Help">Learn more about Scribd.com</a>.) In order to use Scribd.com, you have to sign up for a user account. These accounts are free of charge.</p>
						<p class="Para">A Scribd user account lets you maintain ownership of your documents. It associates your documents with you, so others know who made them. It also allows you and no one else to modify settings relating to your documents, and to view private documents.</p>
						<p class="Para">In order to protect your private data, a Scribd user account has a username and a secret password. To use the Scribd.com website, you must provide the correct username and password. If someone else knows your username and password, they will be able to modify, delete, and view all your documents on Scribd.</p>
						<p class="Para">Scribd user accounts also require an email address. This is so Scribd can notify you of any important events. As you explore Scribd.com, you will discover a wide variety of features, such as self-publishing, document selling, and advertising revenue sharing. A valid email address is necessary because it&rsquo;s very important to receive financial information related to documents you sell or sell ad space on. Even if you don&rsquo;t intend to use any of these advanced features, we must legally require a valid email address in case you upload copyright documents or other illegal material. (We are legally required to notify you of the infraction.)</p>
						
						<h2>Email address privacy</h2>
						<p class="Para">Scribd does not sell email addresses. Scribd user email addresses are not shared and are not visible on any part of the web site unless the account owner authorizes it.</p>
						<p class="Para">Scribd will email you periodic emails with information on what&rsquo;s happening with your documents, and may occasionally send other informative emails, but a user can elect to opt out of this feature on their Notifications page.</p>
						<p class="Para">For more information, read the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/privacy">Scribd Platform Privacy notice</a>.</p>
