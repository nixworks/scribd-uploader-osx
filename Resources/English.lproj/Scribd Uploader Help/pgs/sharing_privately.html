					<div class="Intro">
						<p class="Para">If you upload a document privately (see <a href="help:anchor='uploading_privately' bookID=Scribd Uploader Help">Uploading files that only I can see</a>), other people won&rsquo;t be able to view the document unless they have its web address (URL). The web address is not something easily guessed. This is called &ldquo;security through obscurity.&rdquo;</p>
						<p class="Para">Normally, when you upload a document to Scribd, it gets a URL like <tt>http://www.scribd.com/doc/123-document-title</tt>. In order to prevent someone from guessing the URL of your private document, however, private documents get a URL like <tt>http://www.scribd.com/doc/123-document-title?secret_password=f9u2c12193mqog8</tt>. The string of letters and numbers at the end is chosen randomly and makes the URL difficult to guess. If that string is left out or is incorrect, the document is not shown.</p>
						<p class="Para">Therefore, if you want someone to view your document, simply give them the URL. It will include the correct string of letters and numbers, and they will be able to view it. Don&rsquo;t paste the URL in a public place, and don&rsquo;t give it to people whom you don&rsquo;t want looking at your private document.</p>
