					<div class="Intro">
						<p class="Para">Scribd Uploader is a continual work in progress. Occasionally Scribd may elect to release a version of the Uploader despite knowing that some bugs remain in the software. This is usually because the bugs, while not ideal, were not so intrusive as to warrant a release delay. For your information, all bugs in Scribd Uploader known to Scribd are listed below.</p>

								<li>
									<p class="Para">Users on Mac OS X versions before 10.5 should see a more friendly error message.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="Para">The alert that appears when a file is moved or deleted between Scribd Uploader processes is not aligned with its parent window.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p class="Para">The error sheet that appears after a login-password mismatch is not the front window by default. This appears to be a limitation of spawning sheets from other sheets.</p>
