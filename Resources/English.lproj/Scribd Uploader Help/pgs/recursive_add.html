					<div class="Intro">
						<p class="Para">If you have a large number of files to add at once, you can tell Scribd Uploader to search a folder for files that it can upload. Scribd Uploader will search the folder for documents and automatically add them to the file list. You can then review and edit the list before you upload your documents.</p>
						<p class="Para">The folder search is recursive, meaning that subfolders will be searched, and folders within those subfolders, and so on.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Task">
						<div class="Name">Searching a folder and adding uploadable files:</div>
						<ol class="ListNumber">
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Choose Add All in Directory&hellip; from the File menu.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Use the file browser that appears to locate the folder to search.</p>
								<p class="Para">If you want to add more than one folder to search, you can command-click to select multiple folders, or shift-click to select a range of folders.</p>
								<p class="Para">Any subfolders in the folder you choose will be searched as well.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p class="Para">Click the Scan button in the file browser, or press Return.</p>
								<p class="Para">A progress bar will appear as your folders are being searched. When the search is complete, the bar will disappear and your files will be in the list.</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div class="Outro">
						<p class="Para">Only the documents that Scribd.com supports will be added to the list. You can now review and edit each document, deleting those you don&rsquo;t want to upload, before clicking the Upload button.</p>
